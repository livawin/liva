# 📘 Liva (LIVA) Whitepaper  
### Decentralized Prediction Markets on Solana

---

## 📄 PART 1 — INTRODUCTION & VISION

### 1. Abstract

**Liva** is a decentralized prediction market ecosystem built on the Solana blockchain, designed to allow users to predict outcomes across sports, crypto markets, and real-world events in a transparent, trust-minimized, and efficient way.

At the core of the ecosystem is **LIVA**, the native utility and governance token that powers staking, rewards, governance, and liquidity across the platform.

Liva removes centralized intermediaries by using:

- On-chain smart contracts  
- Public token distribution  
- Verifiable settlement logic  
- Permissionless user participation  

---

### 2. Problem Statement

Traditional prediction and betting platforms suffer from multiple structural issues:

#### 2.1 Centralization
- Custodial control over user funds  
- Ability to freeze, block, or confiscate balances  
- Opaque internal settlement mechanisms  

#### 2.2 Lack of Transparency
- Users cannot verify odds, payouts, or reserve balances  
- Results are often resolved by centralized operators  

#### 2.3 Geographic & Regulatory Barriers
- Platform access restricted by country  
- User accounts frequently blocked or limited  

#### 2.4 Inefficient Infrastructure
- High fees  
- Slow settlements  
- Limited user control  

---

### 3. Liva Solution

Liva addresses these issues by introducing:

- Non-custodial prediction markets  
- On-chain settlement  
- Transparent tokenomics  
- Public wallet disclosures  
- Permissionless access  

Users interact directly with smart contracts through **https://liva.win**, maintaining full ownership of their funds at all times.

---

### 4. Vision & Mission

**Vision**  
To become a global, decentralized hub for prediction markets where users can freely participate, earn rewards, and govern the ecosystem without centralized control.

**Mission**
- Build fair and transparent prediction markets  
- Align incentives between users and the protocol  
- Eliminate opaque intermediaries  
- Leverage Solana’s speed and low fees for mass adoption  

---

### 5. Why Solana

Liva is built on Solana due to:

- High throughput (thousands of TPS)  
- Low transaction costs  
- Fast finality  
- Mature DeFi ecosystem  
- Growing retail adoption  

Solana enables prediction markets to operate efficiently at scale without sacrificing decentralization.

### 7. Prediction Market Mechanics

#### 7.1 Market Creation
Markets are created for predefined event categories such as:

- Sports matches  
- Crypto price movements  
- Time-based or outcome-based events  

Each market includes:
- Event metadata  
- Resolution conditions  
- Time boundaries  
- Supported staking assets  

#### 7.2 Participation
Users:
1. Select a market  
2. Choose an outcome  
3. Stake LIVA (or supported assets)  
4. Lock funds until market resolution  

All stakes are held in on-chain contracts.

#### 7.3 Resolution
Market outcomes are resolved using:
- Trusted oracle data  
- On-chain verification logic  
- Predefined resolution rules  

Once resolved:
- Winning participants receive rewards  
- Losing stakes are redistributed according to protocol rules  

---

### 8. Rewards Distribution

Rewards are calculated based on:
- Stake size  
- Correct outcome participation  
- Market liquidity conditions  

Distribution is:
- Fully on-chain  
- Deterministic  
- Verifiable by anyone  

---

### 9. Staking System

LIVA staking provides:
- Long-term incentives for holders  
- Platform stability  
- Reward emissions tied to protocol usage  

Staking pools are governed by:
- Emission schedules  
- Lock periods  
- On-chain accounting  

---

### 10. User Experience (UX)

The Liva app is designed to be:
- Mobile-friendly  
- Fast and intuitive  
- Wallet-native  
- Non-custodial by default  

No user accounts or KYC are required.
